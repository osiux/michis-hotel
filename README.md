To run project locally, after installing dependencies (`yarn install`), this two commands need to run on separated terminal windows/tabs (because both commands hijacks terminal):

```
yarn dev:frontend
yarn dev:backend
```

You will have a simple UI in http://127.0.0.1:5173/ and the API at http://localhost:3000/
